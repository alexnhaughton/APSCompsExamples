# APSCompsExamples

Immortalizing comps resources for future years. If you have materials you want to add submit a pull request! If you don't know how I have a tutorial for that [here](https://github.com/kirklong/ASTR_6000_Workshop). GitHub limits file sizes by default to 50 MB, but you can add larger files using Git Large File Storage &mdash; follow [these](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-large-files-on-github) instructions to set that up if you need.
