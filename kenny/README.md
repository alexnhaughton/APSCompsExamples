I have uploaded pdfs of my paper and presentation. I made relatively minor changes to my paper before submitting it to the Astrophysical Journal for publication, and I received minor revisions from the referee on the submitted draft. Most of the questions I received in my oral exam were directed at background material from my paper (i.e. stuff I wasn't able to cover in a 45min presentation). Know your background material well! Your classmates can likely predict the stuff that examiners will want to address in the oral session by reading your paper. You might very well be able to as well, but sometimes it's hard when you're so close to / familiar with your own work. 

A note on accessibility of the presentation: You want your talk to be accessible / understandable to as many people as possible. Start basic. Everyone, and I mean everyone, will benefit from a gentle easing into your research. People who know your field love to hear stuff they already know! People know don't know it will be able to hang with you for at least the beginning of your talk if you make it simple, use metaphors, and put intentionality behind how you communicate. You will describe science that you know better than anyone else, but the point of your talk is share your area of expertise, so make it easy (or, easier) for people to be there with you. In your paper you can explore more complex and niche topics in depth.
