# Kirk's resources

This directory contains a link to my PowerPoint (hosted on GitHub LFS), the PDF of my paper I submitted, and some notebooks showcasing how I generated the graphics used in my presentation. Let me know if you have any questions!

Here is a [link to the Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/mvccwvbkftnk) of my paper if you want to see the TeX code for that as well. There are two minor errata in the paper I discovered after my comps (one of which Steve questioned me about in the closed-door session) which I've since fixed in the journal version of the paper but am too lazy to fix here. I figure it shows you don't have to be perfect! After the journal version is accepted I'll update this with a link to that as well so you can see the evolution from Comps paper to Journal article if you care about that as well.
