This directory contains a link to my PowerPoint (hosted on GitHub LFS), the PDF of my paper I submitted, and some notebooks showcasing how I generated the graphics used in my presentation. Let me know if you have any questions!

Here is a [link to the Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/mvccwvbkftnk) of my paper if you want to see the TeX code for that as well.
