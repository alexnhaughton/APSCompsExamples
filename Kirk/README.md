# Kirk's resources

This directory contains a link to my [PowerPoint](CompsPresentation.pptx) (hosted on GitHub LFS), the [PDF of my paper as it was when I submitted](CompsPaperKirkLong.pdf), some notebooks showcasing how I generated the graphics used in my presentation, and sample code showcasing how I actually did my research. Some light documentation for all the accessory stuff:

[`DiskWind`](DiskWind): This folder contains a Julia module that was the crux of my model and generates most of the outputs.

[`graphics.ipynb`](graphics.ipynb): This notebook generated a lot of the toy model graphics shown in my presentation, including the schematic of the AGN + BLR (figure 1 in the paper), the animation showcasing how [line profiles change in response to geometry and inclination](vMap.mp4), the [Spud centroid graphic](spudCentroids.mp4), and the [echo image animation](echoImage.mp4). 

[`MCtempViz.py`](MCtempViz.py): This is the script I used to generate the animations showcasing how the parallel temperature emcee sampler wandered through parameter space (see [MCTempViz.mp4](MCTempViz.mp4) and [MCViz.mp4](MCViz.mp4)).

[`jPyMCViz.ipynb`](jPyMCViz.ipyng): This notebook contains a lot of figure generating routines which I used in both the paper and the presentation.

[`RMCombined.jl`](RMCombined.jl): This script generates static echo image map comparisons from two sets of data, a version of which produced the echo image figure in my paper.

Finally, here is a [link to the Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/mvccwvbkftnk) of my comps paper if you want to see the TeX code for that as well. There are two minor errata in the paper I discovered after my comps (one of which Steve questioned me about in the closed-door session) which I've since fixed in the journal version of the paper but am too lazy to fix here. I figure it shows you don't have to be perfect! After the journal version is accepted I'll update this with a link to that as well so you can see the evolution from Comps paper to Journal article if you care about that as well.

Let me know if you have any questions, and good luck!
